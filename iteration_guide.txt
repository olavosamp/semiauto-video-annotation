new_unlabeled_set -> Complement of current labeled set and last iteration unlabeled.
                     Creates new and smaller unlabeled set represented by a csv file
* dataset_inference on unlabeled set -> automatic annotation
(sampe_auto_labeled) -> optional, used only to measure automatic annotation error percentage
